# 🚀 DevOps Learning Roadmap (Personal Reference)

This document tracks what I need to learn to become a strong Junior / L1 DevOps Engineer.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Infrastructure as Code (High Priority)

### 🔹 Terraform

- [ ] Install & setup Terraform
- [ ] Understand providers & resources
- [ ] Create EC2 using Terraform
- [ ] Create VPC with subnets
- [ ] IAM roles & policies
- [ ] Remote backend (S3)
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] State management
- [ ] Variables & outputs

### 🎯 Goal Project

Provision using Terraform:

- VPC
- EC2
- ECR
- Kubernetes cluster

---

## ✅ Phase 2 – Monitoring & Observability

### 🔹 Prometheus

- [ ] Install on Kubernetes
- [ ] Understand metrics
- [ ] Configure scrape targets

### 🔹 Grafana

- [ ] Connect to Prometheus
- [ ] Create dashboards
- [ ] Create alerts

### 🔹 Logging (Basic)

- [ ] Understand ELK stack
- [ ] Centralized logging concept

### 🎯 Goal Project

Deploy Prometheus + Grafana on Kubernetes  
Create CPU and memory dashboards

---

## ✅ Phase 3 – Advanced Kubernetes

- [ ] Deployments
- [ ] Services
- [ ] Ingress (NGINX)
- [ ] ConfigMaps
- [ ] Secrets
- [ ] RBAC
- [ ] Helm charts
- [ ] HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
- [ ] Liveness & readiness probes
- [ ] Rolling updates & rollbacks

### 🎯 Goal

Be able to debug:

- Pod crash
- Image pull error
- Networking issue
- Resource limit issue

---

## ✅ Phase 4 – Linux Mastery

- [ ] Process management (ps, top, kill)
- [ ] Systemctl & services
- [ ] Logs analysis (/var/log)
- [ ] File permissions (chmod, chown)
- [ ] SSH troubleshooting
- [ ] Networking basics (netstat, ss, curl)
- [ ] Disk usage (df, du)

---

## ✅ Phase 5 – CI/CD Advanced

- [ ] Multi-stage pipelines
- [ ] Pipeline caching
- [ ] Artifacts handling
- [ ] Blue-green deployment
- [ ] Canary deployment
- [ ] Environment-based deployment
- [ ] Secrets management in pipelines

---

## ✅ Phase 6 – Cloud Deep Dive (AWS)

- [ ] VPC networking basics
- [ ] IAM deep understanding
- [ ] Security groups
- [ ] ECR lifecycle policies
- [ ] EC2 autoscaling basics
- [ ] CloudWatch logs & alarms

### Optional:

- [ ] Prepare for AWS SAA certification

# 💻 Final Capstone Project (Resume Booster)

Build a complete DevOps project:

- Application (Node.js / Python)
- Dockerized
- CI/CD pipeline
- Infrastructure via Terraform
- Deploy to AWS
- Kubernetes cluster
- Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
- Proper README documentation

---

## 📌 Focus Rules

- Do not learn random tech
- Go deeper, not wider
- Practice debugging
- Document everything on GitHub

---

## 🎯 Target Outcome

Become confident in:

- Infrastructure provisioning
- Kubernetes production deployment
- Monitoring & troubleshooting
- Secure CI/CD pipelines
